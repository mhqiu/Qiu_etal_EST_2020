## README

This repository contains supporting data for Qiu et al., Environmental Science & Technology (2020) "Improving evaluation of energy policies with multiple goals: Comparing ex ante and ex post approaches".

-- **Firm level data** (identifying information, ownership, locations, economic variables, etc.).

-- **GEOS-Chem simulations:** <br/>
Data file includes annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and the component species under different scenarios at the spatial resolution of 0.5x0.667 degrees.
The spatial range: latitude: -11, 55; longitude: 70, 150.1<br/>
E.g., "exante_sens_PM_25" is the annual average PM2.5 concentration under the "exante sensitivity scenario"<br/>
Species names follow the variable names from GEOS-Chem (http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/index.php/Species_in_GEOS-Chem)<br/>

-- **The policy impacts on energy, emissions and mortality under different scenarios (at the provincial level):** <br/>
Policy impacts are calculated as "policy case - counterfactual baseline". Therefore negative values in energy, SO2 emissions and mortality indicate reduction in energy use, emissions and mortality under policy.
